Parser:
    * parseDef(): error checks for KEYWORD, while also checking for NAME,
     but discards keyword info. Why?
    * Maybe check for kind and details? Needs to be KEYWORD and define respectively

Node:
    * checks for var, num, and other nonexistent types
    * need to change types

evaluate:
* If node.isKind(something):
    * based on what it is, we know it if has 0, 1, or 2 nodes
    1. Takes a node,
    2. Looks at it's children
    3. tries to get it's children by recursively calling
    4. children can either be lists or nums
    5. will return an item type that can be a list or a num
